# GitGram_AI
Gitgram makes it easier and more entertaining for users to find GitHub accounts.

Functionalities:
1. Users may search for and locate GitHub user profiles much more easily and quickly.
2. More seamless and immediate profile updates
3. A timetable for the actions (Push, Pull, Watch, Create, Fork, etc.)
4. Personalise your favourites and have them available at all times.

Here, I created a GitGram and searched for the Google Account to test if it was present or not, and it worked!

I hope this was helpful!!
